This project uses third party API services, and API Keys for this project to use are not distributed with this project. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Contact the developer to receive a copy of APIKeys.swift, the source code file for holding API keys used in this app
2. Open the Xcode project, and delete any existing file references in the project to APIKeys.swift
3. If needed, open the project.pbxproj file and verify all file references to APIKeys.swift are removed before continuing
