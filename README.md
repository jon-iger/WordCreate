# FacadeDesignPOC
Have fun with friends making new words! Make as many words as possible in three turns and collect points for every correct word's letter count. Whoever has the most points at the end wins! Make sure your spelling skills are in shape though. All words played are checked for spelling accuracy before they are scored. Playable on iPhone/iPad. Not meant for App Store distribution.
- Score the most points and win the game
- Words are searched on Google and checked for accuracy with the SerpAPI available at https://serpapi.com
- App is built as a demo POC for the Facade design pattern done in Swift
- Facade object "GameJudgeFacade" stores all objects and actions that can be done in the game such as judging the game, determining winners, and holding all of the player words in a single object
