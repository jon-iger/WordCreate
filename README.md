# Word Create!
Have fun with friends creating new words! Make as many words as possible in three turns and collect points for every correct word's letter count. Whoever has the most points at the end wins! Make sure your spelling skills are in shape. All words played are checked for spelling accuracy before they are scored. Playable on iPhone/iPad. This project is not meant for App Store distribution and is a showcase to demonstrate the Facade design pattern implementation in Swift iOS development.

- Score the most points and win the game.
- Words are searched on Google and checked for accuracy with the SerpAPI available at https://serpapi.com.
- Facade object "GameJudgeFacade" stores all objects and actions that can be done in the game such as judging the game, determining winners, and holding all of the player's words in a single object.
- Built using reusable SwiftUI views.
